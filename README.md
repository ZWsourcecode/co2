This project analyzes monthly observation data (2000-2016) and simulation data (2000-2017) from CarbonTracker Transport Model 5 and attempt to estimate global mean CO2 mole fraction and atmospheric CO2 mass.

## Carbontracker station data
The observed CO2 mole fraction is derived from 200 out of 246 global-wide distributed stations, which include surface-based, shipboard-based and tower-based measurements.
(df_selectedfile_ctracker.csv under [output](/output), generated by [R code](/code/selection_ctracker.R)) The original data are in NetCDF format and have been converted to txt format. ([R code](/code/selection_ctracker.R))

## Carbontracker model data
CarbonTracker simulated CO2 mole fraction with ~25 km horizontal resolution and 25 levels in the vertical. The vertical level 1 data is used to estimate global CO2 mole fraction. The full layers data are used to calculate atmospheric CO2 mass.

## Carbontracker model data at WDCGG locations
Extract carbontracker model output at the location of WDCGG's 129 stations. Carbontracker data at multiple levels will be used, base on the altitude of measurement is taken at each WDCGG station.

## WDCGG station data
The monthly data from WDCGG's 129 stations are used to evaluate Carbontracker model outputs. 
Global locations of selected 200 observation stations within CarbonTracker project (red dots) and the 129 stations used in WDCGG analysis (Tsutsumi et al., 2009) (blue triangles), shown as bellow.
